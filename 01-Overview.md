#**Overview of Docker on RHEL lab**

##**1.1 Overview of Docker on Red Hat Enterprise Linux**

The rapid adoption of Docker demonstrates that the benefits of Docker and containers in general are valued by enterprise developers and administrators. Specifically, Docker and containers enable rapid application deployment by only including the minimal runtime requirements of the application. This minimal size and the mentality of replacing containers, rather than updating them, simplifies maintenance. Additionally, containers allow applications bring all of their runtime requirements with them, making them to be portable across multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux environments. This means that containers can ease testing and troubleshooting efforts by providing a consistent runtime across development, QA and production environments. Finally, containers run applications in isolated memory, process, filesystem and networking spaces, with less overhead than virtualization. The isolation ensures that any security breaches are limited to the container.

Red Hat has been investing in containers for a number of years in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and has been working on Docker in the upstream community since mid-2013. Red Hat's commitment to Docker and container technology is demonstrated not just in this background work, but also in the efforts to establish Docker containers as a standard part of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux environment. Establishing these capabilities as a part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a major step in making them consumable by enterprise customers.



##**1.2 Assumptions**

This lab manual assumes that you are attending an instructor-led training class and that you will be using this lab manual in conjunction with the lecture.

This manual also assumes that you have been granted access to a single Red Hat Enterprise Linux server with which to perform the exercises.

A working knowledge of Linux-based tools and services such as telnet, Apache, etc... are assumed.  If you do not have an understanding of any of these technologies, please let the instructors know.

##**1.3 What you can expect to learn from this training class**
